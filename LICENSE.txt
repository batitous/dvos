                           GPL Exception Text

  In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holder of Dvos,
gives You the additional right to link the unmodified code of this Program with
code not covered under the GNU General Public License ("Non-GPL Code") and to
distribute linked combinations including the two, subject to the limitations
in this paragraph.

   1. Non-GPL Code permitted under this exception must only link to the
      unmodified code of this Program through those well defined interfaces
      identified as "Approved Interfaces".
   2. Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement
      that details to the recipient the version of Dvos used and an
      offer by yourself to provide the Dvos source code should the
      recipient request it.
   3. The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related
      product.
   4. The combined work is not itself a binary library intended for linking
      into other software applications.

                           The Approved Interfaces

   1. The files of Non-GPL Code may include the unmodified Dvos
      distribution header files contained under:
        ./dvos/hw/include
        ./dvos/kernel/include
      without causing the resulting work to be covered by the GNU General
      Public License.
   2. The files of Non-GPL Code may link to the unmodified Dvos
      distribution files contained under:
        ./dvos/kernel/source
        ./dvos/hw/
      without causing the resulting work to be covered by the GNU General
      Public License.
   3. The files of Non-GPL Code may link to, or include, the modified or
      unmodified Dvos distribution files contained under:
        ./project
      without causing the resulting work to be covered by the GNU General
      Public License.

  Only the copyright holder of Dvos may make changes or additions to the
list of Approved Interfaces.

  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the
Program code and other code used in conjunction with the Program except the
Non-GPL Code covered by this exception.
